# Quality Level Limit Mod for Wurm Unlimited

A very special purpose mod that allows to limit the quality level of 
items obtained by foraging, botanizing and rummaging based on the
corresponding skill level of the player.

Requirements:

* [Ago's Mod Launcher](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher), version 0.21 ([Wurm Forum page](http://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/133085-released-server-mod-loader-priest-crops-seasons-server-packs-bag-of-holding/))
* Intended for Wurm Unlimited 1.1.2.3

As always with modded content, I rid me of all liability. Although the 
mod is non-invasive and can be removed at any time without any effect on 
the world, make a backup. Just to be sure.

**Installation:** Just extract the contents of the .zip file into the 
mods folder in your WurmServerLauncher directory. If you don't have a 
mods directory, you need to install Agos's mod launcher.
