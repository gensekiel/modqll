# Quality Level Limit Mod for Wurm Unlimited

A very special purpose mod that allows to limit the quality level of
items obtained by several actions based on the corresponding skill
level of the player.
Adding the quality limit to other actions may be added on request.

Actions for which QL can be limited (can be disabled separately in
the properties file):

* Foraging & rummaging
* Botanizing
* Digging
* Picking flowers
* Harvesting farms
* Picking sprouts
* Harvesting trees
* Harvesting bushes
* Chopping trees
* Cutting grass
* Cutting grass around trees
* Surface mining (including gems, etc.)
* Mining (including gems, etc.)
* Fishing

Requirements:

* [Ago's Mod Launcher](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher), version 0.43 ([Wurm Forum page](http://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/133085-released-server-mod-loader-priest-crops-seasons-server-packs-bag-of-holding/))
* Intended for Wurm Unlimited 1.9.1.5

As always with modded content, I rid me of all liability. Although the
mod is non-invasive and can be removed at any time without any effect on
the world, make a backup. Just to be sure.

**Installation:** Just extract the contents of the .zip file into the
mods folder in your WurmServerLauncher directory. If you don't have a
mods directory, you need to install Agos's mod launcher.
